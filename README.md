## Walkthrough
<!-- - The first page is the landing page of the project where basic information about the website and login/register functionalities can be accessed.
- Then we come down to login and register where if the user successfully completes the registration process,is directed to the login page.
- After login the user is redirected to the products page where different catefories of products can be found.
- On clicking on any of the category on the products page we route to the add to cart page where products are filtered according to the category selected.
- In the add to cart page, user can also filter according to the subcategory. For every category we have sub-categories i.e. there's a one-to-many relationship between category and subcategory.
- On clicking the green coloured cart button on the navbar we can have a look at what all items are there in the cart and also remove them. 
- Once the user is sure about the products in the cart they can click the Go to checkout button, where they will be routed to the checkout page.
- After entering the required details. The order will be placed. -->
